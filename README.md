DNA Altering (Omnitrix) - Decompiled Source
Overview
This repository contains the decompiled source code of the DNA Altering app (previously known as Omnitrix) for Wear OS. The app was discontinued, and the last known version is v2.1.5 (package: eu.adi007.omnitrix).

The APK provided here is a cracked version by HULBUSTERV5, and I am not the original creator of this app. However, I am making the files available for preservation and in the hope that someone with the necessary skills can reverse-engineer and rebuild a functional version for modern Android devices.

Background
I previously made a Reddit post searching for this app:
