**DNA Altering (Omnitrix) - APK Files**

**Overview**
This repository contains the APK files of the DNA Altering app (previously known as Omnitrix) for Wear OS. The app was discontinued, and the last known version is v2.1.5 (package: eu.adi007.omnitrix).

The APK provided here is a cracked version by HULBUSTERV5, and I am not the original creator of this app. However, I am making the files available for preservation and in the hope that someone with the necessary skills can analyze it and potentially rebuild a functional version for modern Android devices.

**Background**
I previously made a Reddit post searching for this app:

After finally locating the APK, I have decided to upload the APK files here on GitHub so that the community can access and experiment with them. I will also be making a new Reddit post to keep others updated.
